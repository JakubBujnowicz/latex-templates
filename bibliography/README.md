# Bibliography

Store bibliography files here.

The main document always tries to use `bibliography/bibliography.bib` file.
However, two ways of storage are available:

1) everything in the main `bibliography.bib` file,
2) each entry in a separate `.bib` file, preferably named with it's identifier.
This can be later compiled into a single file using `Rcode/compile_bibliography.R`
and associated scripts.
